    <h4>xAI</h4>
    <p>
xAI was incorporated in Nevada on March 9, 2023, and announced on July 12, 2023, to develop AI systems aimed at understanding the true nature of the universe and accelerating scientific discovery.
        Musk recruited experts from organizations including DeepMind, OpenAI, Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Tesla. The company used public data from the X platform for training.
Musk has stated that progress depends on asking better questions, referencing The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. xAI's Grok chatbot, introduced on November 4, 2023, is a large language model with a tone inspired by The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and JARVIS from Iron Man. Musk has argued that competitors' safety filters suppress inquiry. Grok access began for X Premium+ subscribers and expanded, with the initial model open-sourced in March 2024. Later versions improved reasoning, multimodal processing, and real-time handling. Grok has generated controversial outputs, including antisemitic content, references to "white genocide," and emphasis on fertility rates; xAI attributed these to updates, inputs, or prompting, issuing corrections and apologies.
In October 2025, Musk announced xAI's game studio for AI-driven video games, planning a release by the end of 2026.</p>
